# Blog definition: In simple terms, a blog is a regularly updated website or web page, and can either be used for personal use or to fulfill a business need.

‎

## A brief history — in 1994, Swarthmore College student Justin Hall is credited with the creation of the first blog, Links.net. At the time, however, it wasn't considered a blog … just a personal homepage.

What is a blog post?

‎

A blog post is an individual web page on your website that dives into a particular sub-topic of your blog.

‎

For instance, let's say you start a fashion blog on your retail website. One blog post might be titled, “The Best Fall Shoes for 2023”. The post ties back to your overall blog topic as a whole (fashion), but it also addresses a very particular sub-topic (fall shoes).

Blog vs. Website

‎

A blog is typically a section of your business's website — but, unlike the rest of your website, you need to update the blog section frequently by adding new posts. Additionally, your blog is a tool that allows you to engage more with an audience, either by analyzing how many readers share your blog posts on social, or by allowing readers to comment on your individual posts. In this way, a blog is more like a two-way conversation than the rest of your website. However, a blog can also be an entire website, and often is, if the blog is for personal use alone — for instance, a travel blog.
